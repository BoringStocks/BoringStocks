  <h1>BoringStocks</h1>
  <i>A minimalistic stock information website for the average trader.</i>  
</div>

## Description

We set out to create a platform which would combine the best features of everything that is out there. We wanted to make something simple, yet sleek 😎 and lighting-fast ⚡️. The app has been designed with mobile first principles 📱 and dark mode support 🌘 from the get-go.

## Tech Stack

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - UI Toolkit
* [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org) - Historical chart rendering
* Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript - KISS 💋


## How are we getting the stocks information?
We've decided to go the extra mile and make an in-house API, [StonkScraper](https://github.com/BoringStocks/StonkScraper). If you want to use it yourself or just want to see how it works, you can find it [here](https://github.com/BoringStocks/StonkScraper).

## Who is using the app?
We are commited to being fully transperant and honest.  That's why we use a privacy focused analytics tool, Fathom. If you are curious how much traffic we receive, you can checkout our [dashboard](https://app.usefathom.com/share/gepogeih/boringstocks).
